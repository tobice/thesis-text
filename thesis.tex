\def\Abstract{
The goal of this thesis is to implement a Linked Data driven web application generator. The application generator allows a non-developer user to generate a web application from a source of RDF data. The source is automatically analyzed and the user is provided with a list of available types of applications that can be generated. Each generated application can be configured and published online. The generator is extendable to support new types of RDF data and new types of applications. The generator is a framework, defining an interface for integration of new visualization plugins and providing various tools that speed up development of new plugins. The generator is also a platform, allowing users to create accounts to manage their published applications and also featuring a catalog of published applications and a repository of publicly available data sources. The generator is integrated into LinkedPipes Visualization tool.
