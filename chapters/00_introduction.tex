The Internet of today is full of data and the amount of the data is constantly increasing. By data we mean literary everything that can be found online, may it a huge source of information like Wikipedia or a small Excel table produced by a local government office. Unfortunately, our current ability to use the whole potential of all currently available data is very limited. We want to to explore the data, we want to connect and combine different data sets, we want to look for patterns in the data, we want to make the data available to end users. All of that is possible, yet usually time and resources demanding. 

Let us consider for example the Excel table.  XLSX is a proprietary format that can be officially opened only by a paid proprietary software that offers a large yet still limited set of tools that allow the user to work with data inside the Excel table. It may very well happen that the proprietary tool will not allow us to do what we want at one moment. We might want to combine the contained data with another data set in a completely different format. Or we might want to create a new specialized interactive visualization of the data and publish it online. The latter one is  a pretty reasonable and imaginable request yet to get it done, we would most likely need a computer specialist or possibly even a developer. Those are rare and expensive.

The answer are application generators. Those are tools that allow non-developers to do developers' work which in this case means generate an interactive online application based on the given data set. Such generators already exist, for example for the aforementioned XLSX format (or in general tabular data) but they are usually very limited, in this case to a single type of data.

One of the recent positive trends is that more and more information is published using the Resource Description Framework \cite{rdf} while utilizing the Linked Data model \cite{ld}. Besides being open and offering a natural way of linking and combining different data sets, this framework's very important asset (for our cause) is that it is able to express any kind of information while maintaining its machine readability. So whereas the tabular data based application generator
